      <Parah>
        We believe in an inclusive community and individual expression without
        fear of abuse. We do not tolerate members of our community being shamed,
        bullied, or harassed. Abusive content or behaviour can cause severe
        psychological distress and will be removed from our platform.
      </Parah>
      <SubTitle>Abusive Behaviour</SubTitle>
      <Parah>
        We remove expressions of abuse, including threats or degrading
        statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt
        an individual. This prohibition extends to the use of Talents Explore
        features. To enable expression about matters of public interest,
        critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious
        abusive behaviour against public figures is prohibited.

        consider these online behaviours as forms of abuse and do not allow them
