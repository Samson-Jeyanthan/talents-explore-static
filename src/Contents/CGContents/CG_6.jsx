        Slurs are defined as derogatory terms that are intended to disparage
        groups or individuals based on any protected attributes listed above. To
        minimize the spread of egregiously offensive terms, we remove all slurs
        from our platform, unless the terms are reappropriated, used
        self-referentially (i.e., by members of the protected group), or used in
        a way that does not disparage (e.g., educational context).
