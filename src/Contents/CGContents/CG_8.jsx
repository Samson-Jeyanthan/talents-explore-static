      <SubTitle>Impersonation</SubTitle>
      <Parah>
        We do not allow accounts that pose as another person or entity in a
        deceptive manner. When we confirm a report of impersonation, we may ask
        the user to revise the profile or may ban the account. We do allow
        accounts that are clearly parody, commentary, or fan-based, such as
        where the username indicates that it is a fan, commentary, or parody
        account and not affiliated with the subject of the account.

        Misinformation is defined as content that is inaccurate or false. We
        will remove misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals,
        our community, or the larger public regardless of intent. Significant
        harm includes serious physical injury, illness, or death; severe
        psychological trauma; large-scale property damage, and the undermining
        of public trust in civic institutions and processes such as governments,
        elections, and scientific bodies. This does not include simply
        inaccurate information, myths, or commercial or reputational harm.
