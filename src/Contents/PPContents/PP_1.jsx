      <Parah>
        We collect information that you provide when you set up an account, such
        as your date of birth, username, email address and/or telephone number,
        and password. You can add other information to your profile, such as a

        <PointsIcon /> User Content
      </PointsWrapper>
      <Parah>
        We collect the content you create or publish through the Platform, such
        as photographs, videos, audio recordings, livestreams, and comments, and
        the associated metadata (such as when, where, and by whom the content
        was created). Even if you are not a user, information about you may
        appear in content created or published by users on the Platform. We
        collect User Content through pre-loading at the time of creation,
        import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload
        that User Content, for example, to recommend music based on the video.
        We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your
        device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from
        the Platform or share content between it and a third-party platform. In
        addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions,
        shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location
        information to your User Content.

        content of the message and the associated metadata (such as the time the
        message was sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in
        the communication). We do this to block spam, detect crime, and to
        safeguard our users.

        Third party platforms provide us with information (such as your email
        address, user ID, and public profile) when you choose to sign up for or
        log in to the Platform using sign-in features provided by those third
        parties. We may also receive contact information that you hold or is
        held about you when contact information is synced with our Platform by
        you or another user. When you interact with any third party service
        (such as third party apps, websites or products) that integrate Talents
        Explore Developer Tools, we will receive the information necessary to
        provide you with features like cross-service authentication or
        cross-posting. For example, this will happen if you log in to another
        platform with your Talents Explore account or if you use Talents
        Explore’s “share” button on a third-party platform to share content from
        there to the Platform.
