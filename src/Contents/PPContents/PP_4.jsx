        We use different legal bases depending on why we use your information
        (in other words, the “purpose” of our processing). These legal bases are
        contractual necessity, legitimate interests (ours, yours or those of
        another party), consent, compliance with a legal obligation, performing
        a task in the public interest, and protection of vital interests.
      </Parah>
      <Parah>
        Here we explain the legal bases we rely on when we process your
        information. This section also describes why we use your information,
        how this information is processed, the categories of information
        involved, and the associated rights (which always includes the right to
        access your information). For more information on how to exercise any of
        your rights, please check out the “Your Rights and Choices” section in
        the Privacy Policy.
