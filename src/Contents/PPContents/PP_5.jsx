      <PointsWrapper>
        You have the right to data portability in circumstances where we rely on
        contractual necessity or consent as our legal basis. This means that you

      <ThirdTitle>Object to the processing of your information</ThirdTitle>
      <PointsWrapper>
        You also have the right to object to the processing of your information

        task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or
        those of a third party. In submitting an objection request, please
        provide all relevant information, including the processing activity you
        are objecting to, why you want to object and how the processing activity
        affects you, and any additional information that you think will help us
        review your request. We will stop the particular processing if we don't
        have compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing or don’t
        need it for legal claims.
      </PointsWrapper>
      <ThirdTitle>Restrict the processing of your information</ThirdTitle>
      <PointsWrapper>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        information where (a) you are challenging the accuracy of the
        information, (b) the information has been unlawfully processed, but you
        are opposing the deletion of that information, (c) where you need the
        information to be retained for the pursuit or defence of a legal claim,
        or (d) you have objected to processing and you are awaiting the outcome
        of that objection request.
      </PointsWrapper>
