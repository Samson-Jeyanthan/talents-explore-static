        Certain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of
        residence, are given limited remote access to this information so they
        can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group
        section in How We Share Your Information. This access is limited, secure
        and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and
        authorisation approval protocols.

        We share What Information We Collect with service providers, partners
        and other third party entities, as described in How We Share Your
        Information. These third parties can be located outside your country of

        These entities commit to processing information in compliance with
        applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security
        measures to protect your information. When we transfer your information
        outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from
        an adequate level of data protection by relying on:
      </Parah>

        <PointsIcon />
        Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the European Commission
        under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where
        they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data
        protection. We transfer your information as described in What
        Information We Collect to some countries with adequacy decisions or
      </PointsWrapper>
      <PointsWrapper>
        <PointsIcon />
        Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved
        contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies
        in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved
        equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual
        clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information
        as described in What Information We Collect to certain entities in our
        Corporate Group and third parties in countries without an adequacy
        decision.
